This is a website on one of my favorite drinks, bubble tea. 


I used HTMl to generate the content of the page.  I incorporated an ordered list, unordered list, and a table into my web page/

I used CSS to style the page.  I imported a font and used different colored text in the page as well. 

I attempted to use the front end framework React for this web page and was able to import the template but was unsuccessful in getting any further.  If given more time I would implement this framework to make the page more aesthetically pleasing.
