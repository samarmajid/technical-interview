This file scarpes data from a book website and ooutputs the code to a JSON file.

If a JSON file does not already exist a file is created for the output.

Currently all the data from the website is scarped, and not outputted in a way so that it it matched up with each book on the site but rather just listed.

If given more time on this task, I would organize the output in a way so that the name, price, and rating of a specific book is outputted all at once.  A possible way this coule be done is matching up the indices of the outputted lists.
