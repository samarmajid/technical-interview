This project takses in user input and calls an API to output that information.

A person class is used to function as an API where a person has an eye color, height, and a favorite joke.

A secondary script is used to take in user input and then calls this API.  The output is then printed to the user after being formatted.  

If given more time on this project I would make the API more complex and allow it to take in user input but also utilze a public API to give the user more information.
For example, take in the user input on their eye color but also output some facts on that inputted eye color.
